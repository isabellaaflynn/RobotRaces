# Code for EID 103 Robot Races
arduniojoyread.ino is code for reading values on a joystick. It set a range for quadrants which would relate to different directions and depending on which quadrant your joystick is in, it will read the value assigned to a quadrant and print on the serial monitor.

servotest.ino is the code we used to test the servo motors for challenge 2.
